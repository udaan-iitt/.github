## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<h4>
  Udaan is the first student-run campus newsletter of Indian Institute of
  Technology, Tirupati
</h4>
We initially envisioned Udaan as a record of all student activities in
the institute, but it turned out to be much more than that. Active
participation from many talented people helped us gather a wide
variety of content. The poems, articles, stories, reviews we have
received for Udaan in its first edition shows us its potential to
become the epicenter for student-made literary work. But a closer look
at this content tells us something more. There were original thoughts,
opinions, and most importantly, questions, concealed within words in
plain sight, a brief exposure to what Udaan can grow to be.
<br />
<br />
<b>Our Vision: </b>
<ul>
  <li>
    To evolve as a record of student experiences and activities within
    our institute.
  </li>
  <li>
    To encourage writing and become the center for all kinds of
    student-made literary work.
  </li>
  <li>
    To become a platform that enables students to constructively
    discuss and come up with optimal solutions to various problems
    within our institute.
  </li>
</ul>
